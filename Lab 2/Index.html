<h2>Favorite Pig Breed</h2>
<h3>"My favorite breed is hempshire, which is a orero pig"</h3>
<h4>"These are some Pig Breeds!"</h4>

<p>Hempshire pigs are known as the Oreo pigs. Two black strips and then a white one in the middle of those.</p>

<p>In high school, I showed pigs. Which is where I raise the pig, train it, and then took them to a livestock show and a judge picks which pig is best trained and has the best structure. After that, we would get money for the pig and send it to the slaughterhouse.</p>
