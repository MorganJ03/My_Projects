    <h2>Welcome to Random Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are so cute and fun to play with. I love dogs more than cats. Dogs can feel when you are stressed, or feeling sad. They are always there to cheer you up.</p>

    <p>Dogs are scary to kids, because they are so much bigger than the kids. The kids think they are gong to hurt them.</p>
